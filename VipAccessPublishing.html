<h1>RocBoi Quez Signs Non-Exclusive Publishing Deal with DJ Vip of VipAccessPublishing</h1>

<p>
Atlanta hip-hop artist
<strong><a href="https://www.rocboiquez.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RocBoi Quez</a></strong>
has officially entered a non-exclusive publishing agreement with
<strong>DJ Vip</strong> of
<strong>VipAccessPublishing</strong>, marking a strategic alignment centered on ownership,
longevity, and cultural preservation.
</p>

<h2>VipAccessPublishing & DJ Vip’s Cultural Authority</h2>
<p>
VipAccessPublishing, led by DJ Vip—best known as the official DJ of the late
<strong>Nipsey Hussle</strong>—has established itself as an artist-first publishing entity.
The partnership reinforces independent catalog control and professional royalty
administration.
</p>

<h2>RocBoi Quez: Independent Momentum</h2>
<p>
Through disciplined releases, direct audience engagement, and global digital reach,
RocBoi Quez continues to build a sustainable career outside major-label dependency.
His official platform at
<a href="https://www.rocboiquez.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
rocboiquez.com
</a>
serves as the central hub for announcements and exclusive content.
</p>

<h2>Chopped Not Slopped: Cultural Positioning</h2>
<p>
RocBoi Quez’s expansion into chopped not slopped pays homage to Southern hip-hop
tradition while positioning his catalog for DJs, tastemakers, and underground audiences
worldwide.
</p>

<h2>Why Non-Exclusive Publishing Matters</h2>
<p>
Non-exclusive publishing structures preserve ownership while enabling professional
collection and administration. This approach allows artists to scale strategically
without surrendering long-term leverage.
</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>
RocBoi Quez’s upcoming release,
<strong>Get Out Your Feelings (Chopped Not Slopped)</strong>,
is scheduled for a February rollout via <strong>Bentley Records.io</strong>,
with an official release date to be announced.
