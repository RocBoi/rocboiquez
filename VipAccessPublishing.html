<h1>RocBoi Quez Signs Non-Exclusive Publishing Deal with DJ Vip of VipAccessPublishing</h1>

<p>
Atlanta hip-hop artist
<strong><a href="https://www.rocboiquez.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RocBoi Quez</a></strong>
has officially entered a non-exclusive publishing agreement with
<strong>DJ Vip</strong> of
<strong>VipAccessPublishing</strong>, marking a strategic alignment rooted in ownership,
longevity, and cultural preservation.
</p>

<h2>VipAccessPublishing & DJ Vip’s Cultural Authority</h2>
<p>
VipAccessPublishing, led by DJ Vip—best known as the official DJ of the late
<strong>Nipsey Hussle</strong>—has become synonymous with artist-first publishing strategy.
The partnership reinforces values of independence and catalog control.
</p>

<h2>RocBoi Quez: Proven Independent Momentum</h2>
<p>
Through disciplined releases, direct-to-fan monetization, and global digital reach,
RocBoi Quez has built a sustainable career outside major-label dependency.
His official catalog, exclusive drops, and DJ-ready releases are available directly at
<a href="https://www.rocboiquez.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
rocboiquez.com
</a>.
</p>

<h2>Chopped &amp; Screwed: Cultural Expansion</h2>
<p>
RocBoi Quez’s crossover into chopped and screwed honors Southern hip-hop tradition
while introducing his sound to a wider underground audience. This expansion
extends the lifecycle and emotional resonance of his catalog.
</p>

<h2>Why Non-Exclusive Publishing Wins</h2>
<p>
Unlike traditional publishing contracts, non-exclusive structures preserve ownership
while enabling professional royalty administration and global collection.
This allows RocBoi Quez to scale without surrendering leverage.
</p>

<h2>Call to the Underground</h2>
<p>
This deal signals to underground artists worldwide: build your catalog, protect your
masters, and align with partners—not gatekeepers.
RocBoi Quez exemplifies how independent artists can thrive on their own terms.
