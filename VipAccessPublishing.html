      <h1>RocBoi Quez Signs Non-Exclusive Publishing Deal with DJ Vip of VipAccessPublishing</h1>

The Atlanta-based hip-hop recording artist has officially entered a non-exclusive publishing agreement with DJ Vip, founder of VipAccessPublishing—marking a defining moment for underground and independent hip-hop.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Is DJ Vip and Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>
        DJ Vip is widely respected as the official DJ of the late Nipsey Hussle, a role that places him among a rare class of cultural custodians within hip-hop. His work through VipAccessPublishing reflects a deep commitment to ownership, legacy, and artist-first economics.

      <p>
        RocBoi Quez’s career has been forged through consistency, catalog development, and a refusal to compromise authenticity. His music speaks directly to hustlers, independent thinkers, and fans seeking truth beyond mainstream narratives.
      </p>

      <h2>Crossing Over into Chopped &amp; Screwed</h2>
      <p>
        By expanding into chopped and screwed formats, RocBoi Quez has strengthened his cultural footprint while extending the life and emotional depth of his catalog. His work honors Southern hip-hop traditions while introducing them to new audiences.

      <h2>The Power of a Non-Exclusive Publishing Deal</h2>

      <h2>Motivating the Underground</h2>
      <p>
        RocBoi Quez’s journey sends a message to underground artists everywhere: ownership matters, catalogs matter, and sustainability outweighs short-term exposure. His alignment with VipAccessPublishing is a roadmap—not a shortcut.
      </p>

      <h2>Legacy Over Hype</h2>
      <p>
        This partnership is about longevity, royalties, and cultural preservation. It reflects a belief that real success in hip-hop is measured not by moments, but by legacy.
