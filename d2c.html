<h1>Why Direct-to-Customer Is the New Power Move in Hip-Hop</h1>

<p>
Hip-hop has always thrived on independence. Today, artists like
<strong>RocBoi Quez</strong> are reclaiming revenue by selling music
<strong>directly to fans worldwide</strong> — no streaming gatekeepers.
</p>

<h2>From Trunk Sales to Instant Downloads</h2>

<p>
Just like selling CDs out the trunk, D2C digital drops allow artists
to monetize instantly, connect globally, and control pricing.
</p>

<h2>Get Out Your Feelings — D2C Drop</h2>

<p>
This chopped not slopped release is available exclusively via
<strong>direct download</strong>, engineered for DJs, indie stations,
and underground rotation.
